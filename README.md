# TrackApp
App to log trackday stats, performance, tuning &amp; settings, etc.

So far it's just a rough sketch (sloppy menus, nav, rough ideas)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things To do:
1. Need to get ideas from other apps for layout / design / graphics

2. Main shouldn't be the login page?
  "ACTION_MAIN activity: Start up as the initial activity of a task, with no data input and no returned output."
  What is main activity for tho

3a. Login page should be set as: ?
    "CATEGORY_LAUNCHER: The activity can be the initial activity of a task and is listed in the top-level application launcher`."
  
  3b. how to use "google sign in" -- why have a sign in anyways? to store data in your account instead of only locally / on phone?

4. Edit each indv. Page to make functional & add content

ex. Friends page -- how to make a functional friends system? add people by username / fb / email, watch their stats, comment etc.
    
    tuning page -- how to import database of stock settings for....all sports bikes?
    
    tuning page --- how to include excel forms that calculate stock vs desired settings? 
    
    Tracks page --- idea = select a track, pulls up map, can click each numbered turn & add in notes
                   
   Tracks page  --- import data from other app (Track addict -- 
                    already has all track day recorded data like lap times, speeds, gforce)
